          <p class="p-sm">In 2021 the GitHub All In project embarked on a Maintainers Listening Tour to study the barriers maintainers faced when building more inclusive communities. The Maintainers Listening Tour was part of a larger All In effort that included <a href="/access/students/">providing open source education to marginalized students</a> and collaborating with the Linux Foundation on a <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/the-2021-linux-foundation-report-on-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-in-open-source" target="_blank">DEI in Open Source Research Study</a>. Together, these formed the pillars of the All In Program: Access, Equity, Maintainers, and Data, and the program continues to flourish.</p>
          <p class="p-sm">One of the FY2025 goals for the All In Program is to expand the Maintainers pillar through resources, curriculum, and support for maintainers. As such, we are revisiting this original study to help inform future program opportunities. We would love to include your voice in our current research.</p>
          <p class="p-sm">Join one of our focus groups during Maintainers Month by registering <a href="https://forms.gle/gUFfEXxGjckNqR8o9" target="_blank">here</a> or reaching out to participate in another way <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScw7Xs1B1t2QMj-xsfAxteguza4CniPJTGLgm7XsQBLepK--Q/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
