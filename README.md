### Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Open Source - Created _BY_ Maintainers _FOR_ Maintainers

Industry partners are working together to create a program which will seek to highlight and develop maintainers who are committed to advancing diversity, inclusion, and belonging within their Community. However, we want to create this program _with_ maintainers and not _for_ maintainers.  As part of this process we are on a Maintainers Listening Tour where we are hosting a series of focus groups and individual interviews with maintainers.  

---

# The WHY

Software development should be accessible, inclusive, and sustainable so that developers around the world can contribute, grow, and thrive.  To understand what inclusion means within open source and what were some of the challenges in advancing it throughout the industry, we had conversations and sought out perspectives from a variety of people.  
 
## Vision 

Successfully moving those who are underrepresented and/or historically excluded in open source from:
- _New to Open source_ 
  - Diversity Dimensions: Black, Latinx/Hispanic, Native Indigenous, Women, Abilities (Physical, Neurodiverse)
  - Geographical: (Latin America, India/APAC, Africa)
  - Position: (Students, Career Changers, Retirees, Military veterans, Formerly/Currently incarcerated)
- Repeat open source contributors
- Community Leaders/Maintainers
- Advancement as:
  - (Technical) Leaders in corporations
  - (Technical) leadership in  open source social sector initiatives
  - Founders with financial backing

## Guiding Principles 

- All In is an open source **community of people first**, a set of programs second.  The Community should have a voice and opportunities to contribute.
- All In is an immersive, end to end approach. There will be high touch elements of this program that will need to be balanced with scalability.  
- All In programming will be open sourced.  We will seek to offer participants programming from multiple partners and stakeholders who are operating successful DEI programs and are committed to advancing diversity and inclusion within open source.
- **Equity** will be prioritized.  There are many that would benefit from a well-resourced immersive program. All In will prioritize those most marginalized amongst visible, non visible and geographical dimensions of diversity.
- **Progress** will be informed by analysis of project trends in CHAOSS metrics and Augur Machine learning, that are heavily relied on for determining how a community is evolving. Examples include new contributor retention, contribution responsiveness, and machine learning for identifying anomalies correlated with risks of changing progress culture. 
- **Success** will emerge from sustained commitment to attracting, and retaining open source contributors from historically marginalized communities, including placing the perspective of people in those communities at the center of discussions within, and across open source projects. 
- The forms and shapes of marginalization are experienced differentently, by different populations in each nation, and region on earth. We will begin work aimed at increasing participation and advancement with historically underrepresented communities in the United States of America as a constraint.

# The WHAT

**_With All In, we want to “open source diversity and inclusion.”_**  All In brings together a rich set of organizations and will open source their proven success to create a more collaborative, open, and end-to-end approach to providing access and an on ramp into open source for people from underrepresented backgrounds and regions.

# The HOW
We want to build All In with the open source community, not for the open source community.  To create the final program design for All In, we will utilize data and insights from three initiatives that will ship over the next few months.

### 1. Maintainers Listening Tour

While we have spoken with several maintainers, we want to hear from a lot more on what challenges they are facing with advancing inclusion within their communities, what’s working and what they would like to see in the All In for Maintainers program. 

To get this feedback from them, we will kick off a series of focus groups, individual conversations with select maintainers and create a way for maintainers who are unable to attend a focus group or individual conversation can participate. We will kick off the first focus group in conjunction with [GitHub’s Global Maintainer Summit 2021](https://globalmaintainersummit.github.com/) which is taking place June 8-9, 2021.

### 2. Open Source Survey

- _July 23_:  Friday’s newsletter - announce closing 

- _July 29_: Survey closes

- _July 30_ - ?:  Qualitative Interviews

- _July 30 - October 15_:  Survey translation and Analysis 

- _Week of September 20_: Linux Foundation publishes teaser announcement of high level insights and findings

- _September 27-30_: Presentation on high level insights and findings
Teaser presentation at Open Source Summit.  Presentation will be made publicly available.

- _November 2-4_:   
Presentation at LF Member Summit.  Additional high level insights released

- _December_ - Final report published.  

We must have data in order to track our progress. Whenever you hear stats around diversity and inclusion in open source, most often our [2017 Open Source Survey](https://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/) is cited. As part of the All In effort, we will relaunch the survey to get a better understanding of the progress we’ve made since 2017. 

If you want more information on the 2017 survey, here are more resources:
1. Repo: https://github.com/github/open-source-survey-internal
2. Repo: https://github.com/github/open-source-survey
3. Issues:https://github.com/github/open-source-survey-internal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed
4. Survey Website: https://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/
5. Citation of data set: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=0&q=opensourcesurvey.org&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5
6. Press:  https://www.wired.com/2017/06/diversity-open-source-even-worse-tech-overall/

In 2017, we ran the survey on the GitHub platform. While we are a very critical player within the open source ecosystem, we are not the only player. There are contributors to open source who are on other platforms and are engaged in other communities. In order to advance diversity and inclusion within all of open source, we need to measure across the entire ecosystem.

We have partnered with the [Linux Foundation Research]( https://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/research/) who will run the survey mid-July 2021 across all of open source. The questions from the 2017 survey will be included in order to have longitudinal data and additional questions will be added to help better understand the demographics of users within open source. We are exploring possibilities of what we can ask given international considerations around data collection and personally identifiable (PII) constraints.

We also want to note that GitHub is running another survey this summer.  The survey we will run as part of All In in partnership with the Linux Foundation will focus more on diversity demographics and inclusion. The other survey will be led solely by GitHub as part of Octoverse and will focus on developer productivity and community.  For more information about that survey, visit this [link](https://github.com/github/octoverse2021). 

### 3. Pilot

We have kicked off a pilot that consists of two tracks, All In for Maintainers and All In For Students.  We will will execute an abbreviated three-month version of All In for Maintainers and run the full program for All In for Students. 

**All In for Maintainers** ─ Selected primarily from GitHub Stars; Provide development and direct program support to increase diversity within contributor acquisition and retention. 

**All In for Students** ─ Selected from Historically Black College or University (HBCU) partners; Create a clear path into open source for students from underrepresented backgrounds through a paid program that provides professional development, open source education, an open source practicum, and summer internship experience with a corporate partner.

## All In for Maintainers

All In is an immersive program that provides inclusive development and training, and direct program management support to increase diversity within select communities through focused contributor acquisition and contributor retention efforts.

### Inclusive development for community leaders
- **_Unconscious bias training for community leaders_** - Covering topics such as easing technology barriers for users, reducing bias between paid and unpaid contributors, and tips on how to interrupt non inclusive dialog within their community (e.g., active bystander training).
- **_A community health assessment_** - Helping leaders identify causes and instances of non inclusive dialog and train them on how to use the community health tools going forward.
- **_Accessibility training_** - Developing and sharing guiding principles to create a more accessible community.  

### Contributor attraction
- **_Badging_** - Provide every contributor to an All In community an All In badge to display on their profile. 
- **_Targeted marketing_** - Attract new contributors via widely distributed newsletters and other forms of communication. 
- **_Access or earn incentives and perks_** - Connect through programs and initiatives such as Microsoft-LinkedIn-GitHub global skills initiative, LinkedIn Learning and provide opportunities to receive rewards such as codespace licenses, certifications from corporate partners, and special passes to events.

### Contributor retention
- **_New User Triage_** - Create a series of tasks and responsibilities that contribute to the success of a project but can be done by someone with little to no coding experience, allowing them to be part of the community while developing their coding skills. 
- **_Code of Conduct Analysis and Update_**  - Provide a review of all codes of conduct and provide them with recommendations to make their codes of conduct more inclusive. 
- **_Inclusive language_** - Scan project code and documentation for non inclusive language and update as necessary.

## All In for Students
All In for Students is a paid, 12-month program for select college students from underrepresented backgrounds who are often overlooked during the corporate recruitment process for a variety of reasons. During the program, students will receive professional development training, open source education, a structured open source practicum, and ultimately a summer internship experience with a corporate partner. 

### Summer Internship
- Upon successful completion of professional development, education on open source, completed real-world applied open source experience within a company, and ongoing mentorship from the employee resource group, students will be guaranteed an opportunity to intern at the corporate partner’s company for the following summer.  As things sometimes happen, if the company deems that they are unable to extend the internship offer for any reason, they must provide a compelling reason and share clear, actionable feedback. We will then provide coaching and mentoring to the student to help them close any gaps and prepare them for future opportunities.  We will not “drop” any students throughout this entire program.

### Open Source Education
- Students will learn the history and culture of open source, receive a primer on privacy and ethics in open source, and participate in experiential learning that will allow them to make their first open source contributions and begin building their open source resume.
- UMass’ data shows that students change their majors within the first two years of the curriculum as they do not believe there is an opportunity for social impact within a career in tech. We will have members of open source communities who focus on social impact speak to the students to dispel this myth. 

### Professional Development
- Students will develop professional skills including communication, building their own brand, negotiation, and leadership competencies that will help them thrive in a tech environment.

### Semester Open Source Practicum
- All In student participants will be matched and paid to participate in an open source project with one of the corporate participants to get real-world direct experience with open source within the culture of a tech company.  

### Mentoring
- Each student will be paired with two mentors from the employee resource group at the company that will host them for their semester open source practicum and summer internship.  The mentors will be matched and connected with them prior to the start of the summer professional development program and will support them throughout the entire twelve months of the All In program.

# IMPACT

We will know that All In is successful when:
- Maintainers receive additional development on creating an inclusive culture within their community and direct assistance with attracting and retaining more people from underrepresented backgrounds.
- When more people from underrepresented backgrounds find an on ramp to participation and find meaningful ways to contribute to open source.
- When students from underrepresented backgrounds and regions have a clear pathway to success in open source.
- When measurable progress, and best practices and solutions are distributed in an organized way from a trusted source that can be scaled and sustained within any community.

## Measurements for Success
- **Short term**
   - Expanded Pipeline
      - Expanded pipeline for corporate participants.  Tapping into talent beyond the traditional.
      - Access and exposure to more corporate partners for universities who do not typically appear on recruiting radars of top, international companies.
      - An on-ramp and lower barriers to entry for students who are typically excluded around dimensions of diversity and for other qualitative reasons.
   - Inclusive Communities
      - Identification and improvement of opportunities  presented as a result of the Open Source Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Survey.
      - Diversity and inclusion positioned as a foundational element in the creation and operation of an open source community.
- **Long term**
   - Successful movement from:
      - Students/New to Open source 
      - Repeat open source contributors
      - Community Leaders/Maintainers
      - Advancement as:
         - (Technical) Leaders in corporations

# FAQs

### What is All In?

The 2021 pilot of All In powered by GitHub (“All In)  is a focused program for three (3) managers/maintainers sourced from GitHub Stars committed to advancing diversity, inclusion and belonging within their Community and twenty  (20) students from underrepresented backgrounds.

### Who is this for?

The primary desired attributes of All In participants are commitment, openness, curiosity, exploration and a willingness to learn.  Additionally rising talented sophomore or junior Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) students who are often overlooked for opportunities.

### Why are we only focused on students from HBCUs?

We needed to focus the pilot and since we were working within a very short timeframe, we leaned in on already established relationships with HBCUs.  While the initial development of All In focuses on students, once proven, we will expand the program to include those from underrepresented backgrounds beyond students such as career changers, retirees, veterans, currently and formerly incarcerated, international contributors, and others.  We will also be able to expand the number of students across other diversity dimensions and from other [minority serving institutions](https://www.doi.gov/pmb/eeo/doi-minority-serving-institutions-program) (MSIs).  

### Why is this important to participants?

This program allows maintainers to receive dedicated support, education and tools to grow their Community  in an inclusive way as well as connect and partner with other diverse Communities. It also provides a direct connection between companies and underrepresented talent.

### What are the benefits to participants?   
All In maintainer participants will benefit from coordinated access to industry leaders and research as well as receive exposure to and from key initiatives and programs.  Student participants will receive a clear pathway to opportunities in open source and corporate partners.  Corporate partners will benefit from an expanded pool of talent from underrepresented groups. 

### Why is this important to open source?

This program leverages DI&B work that is already occurring within open source. Nothing new is created. Rather we open source the work to create a more sustainable and impactful experience for participants. Intentional and focused efforts advancing diversity, inclusion and belonging for specific Communities and a focused group of students will provide the opportunity to test, iterate and measure impact in a meaningful way in order to develop more scalable and sustainable solutions for everyone. 

### What is out of scope?

The program is not designed for all Communities or all students. While it is being built with scalability in mind, the program management will only be provided for program participants.
