# Goals
The All In community will collaborate and build on research and initiatives that already exist to create immersive, end-to-end approaches to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion in open source. Our goals will be aligned across four pillars: Access, Community, Equity, and Data.

## Access

### [All In for Students ](https://github.com/soyetubo/All-In/blob/main/All%20In%20for%20Students.md)
This is a paid, 12-month program for select college students from underrepresented backgrounds who are often overlooked during the corporate recruitment process. During the program, students will receive professional development training, open source education, a structured 12-week open source project, and ultimately have the opportunity to join one of our corporate partners for a summer internship experience.


### All in for Maintainers
This program is an immersive program that provides inclusive development and training, and direct program management support to increase diversity within select communities through focused contributor acquisition and contributor retention efforts. Components of this program include training on unconscious bias that typically shows up in open source communities, accessibility audits, community hospitality, code of conduct analysis, and inclusive language scans and updates. The final program design will be designed with maintainers with insights from the [Open Source DEI Survey](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/linux-foundation-launches-2021-open-source-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-survey/), the [Maintainers Listening Tour](https://github.com/soyetubo/All-In/blob/main/README.md#maintainers-listening-tour) and the All In for Maintainers pilot.

## Community

### Maintainers Listening Tour
The Maintainers Listening Tour is a series of focus groups and individual interviews with maintainers who are interested in attracting and retaining new contributors with diverse backgrounds in an inclusive way. 

We will be collecting best practices, lessons learned, and stories that highlight:
- What maintainers are doing to advance diversity, inclusion, and belonging within their communities;
- What is working well;
- What is not working well;
- What challenges they are facing that may be prohibiting them from creating a culture of inclusion within their communities; and 
- What they would like to see in a program that is designed for them, All in for Maintainers.

To participate in the Maintainer’s Listening Tour, join us at one of the following conferences to participate in an in-person focus group: 

- [Open Source Summit](https://osselc21.sched.com/event/nCpS)
  - Tuesday, September 28

- [KUBECON and Cloud Native Computing Conference](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/)
  - Date and Time TBD

- [All Things Open](https://2021.allthingsopen.org/)
  - Monday, October 18 

- [Beyond Universe](https://githubuniverse.com/) 
  - Date and Time TBD

## Equity
All In will seek to leverage GitHub’s [Corporate Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) program which allows you to provide direct financial support to the maintainers and projects you love and the open source projects you depend on. We are developing a robust outreach campaign to increase the number of maintainers from underrepresented and/or historically excluded backgrounds and projects that serve under resourced communities. The campaign will also include increased funding to those projects as well. 

## Data
All In will prioritize consistently gathering and analyzing data that will provide insight into the current state of diversity, equity, and inclusion within open source, challenges that need to be addressed and strengths that can be leveraged to take advantage of opportunities to create a more inclusive culture within our communities. We will make informed data-driven decisions, ensure we have short term metrics of success, and monitor longitudinal data to measure long term impact. 

Our first initiative was to create the [Open Source Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Survey](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/linux-foundation-launches-2021-open-source-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-survey/) and partner with the Linux Foundation to survey across the many platforms communities within the open source ecosystem. Preliminary findings will be released September-November 2021 and the full report will be released in December 2021.
