# About Us

All In is a community dedicated to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion within open source.

# Mission

_All In’s mission is to  **“open source diversity and inclusion”**_ by bringing together corporate partners, industry leaders, researchers, and foundations to create more inclusive open source communities for current and future developers from underrepresented backgrounds and regions.

We understand that to open source diversity and inclusion, we have to have the voice of everyone within the community, from contributors, to DEI leaders, to the many organizations who have a vested interest in ensuring that our code is built by a global community that reflects the society in which we live and serve.

**Equity** - 

**Data** -

# Key Initiatives

## Access

The All In Program is a paid 12-month program for select college students from underrepresented backgrounds who are often overlooked during the corporate recruitment process. During the program, students will receive professional development training, open source education, a structured open source practicum, and ultimately a summer internship experience with a corporate partner.  

#### Summer Internship
- Upon successful completion of professional development, education on open source, completed real-world applied open source experience within a company, and ongoing mentorship from the employee resource group, students should be guaranteed an opportunity to intern at the corporate partner’s company for the following summer.

#### Open Source Education
- Students will learn the history and culture of open source, receive a primer on privacy and ethics in open source, and participate in experiential learning that will allow them to make their first GitHub contributions and begin building their open source resume.
- UMass’ data shows that students change their majors within the first two years of the curriculum as they do not believe there is an opportunity for social impact within a career in tech. We will have members of open source communities who focus on social impact speak to the students to dispel this myth. 

#### Professional Development
- Students will develop professional skills including communication, building their own brand, negotiation, and leadership competencies that will help them thrive in a tech environment.

#### Semester Open Source Practicum
- All In student participants will be matched to a paid open source project with one of the corporate participants to get real-world direct experience with open source within the culture of a tech company.

## Maintainers Listening Tour

We are working together to create an open source project, All In for Maintainers, which will highlight and develop maintainers who are committed to advancing diversity, inclusion, and belonging within their own communities. We want to create the program with maintainers for maintainers.  As part of this process we are on a Maintainers Listening Tour where we are hosting a series of focus groups and individual interviews with maintainers who are interested in attracting and retaining new contributors with diverse backgrounds in an inclusive way.  We also want to hear best practices, lessons learned and stories along the way.

## Badging
The All In Program is an immersive program that provides inclusive development and training, and direct program management support to increase diversity within select communities through focused contributor acquisition and contributor retention efforts such as:

#### Inclusive development for the community leaders 
- Unconscious bias training for community leaders - Covering topics such as easing technology barriers for users, reducing bias between paid and unpaid contributors and tips on how to interrupt non inclusive dialog within their community.
- A community health assessment - Will help them identify causes and instances of noninclusive dialog and train them on how to use the tool going forward.
- Accessibility training - Guiding principles to create a more accessible community.  

#### Contributor attraction 
- Badging - Every contributor to an All In community will receive an All In badge to display on their profile. 
- Targeted marketing - Attract new contributors via widely distributed newsletters and other forms of communication. 
- Access or earn incentives and perks - Through programs and initiatives such as Microsoft-LinkedIn-GitHub global skills initiative, LinkedIn Learning, Codespace licenses, certifications from corporate partners, and special passes to events.

#### Contributor retention 
- New User Triage - Create a series of tasks and responsibilities that contribute to the success of a project but can be done by someone with little to no coding experience allowing them to be part of the community while developing their coding skills. 
- Code of Conduct Analysis and Update  - Provide a review of all code of conduct and provide them with recommendations to make their code of conduct more inclusive. 
- Inclusive language - Scan project code for and update if necessary. 
- Accessibility audit - Conduct and provide recommendations and direct support to improve accessibility.

## Data
To advance diversity, equity and inclusion in open source, We understand that decisions must be data informed and to truly measure progress, must have data.  Longitudinal.

We wanted to get data from across the entire open source ecosystem, so we partnered with the Linux Foundation to run the Open Source Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Survey across the many platforms communities within the open source ecosystem.
