[Project Name] prioritizes and reflects on DEI through a regular review of project policies and performance based on the ever-evolving [CHAOSS project](https://chaoss.community) DEI metrics and information in the [All In DEI Resource Hub](https://allinopensource.org/maintainers/DEI-resources/).

        4. Working group meetings provide the opportunity to be led by different people at each meeting. While each working group has identified ‘chairs’, leading a meeting provides an opportunity to lead for all members. 

[Project Name] recognizes that the inclusion of the DEI.md file and the provided reflection on the four DEI metrics does not ensure community safety nor community inclusiveness. The inclusion of the DEI.md file and CHAOSS DEI review statement signals that we are committed to continually improving our DEI by regularly reviewing and reflecting on our project DEI practices, and on a regular and annual basis, updating this statement and project policies in-line with the review findings.

If you do not feel that the DEI.md file appropriately addresses concerns you have about community safety and inclusiveness, please let us, in the [Project Name], know. You can do this by checking out our Code of Conduct (link) to raise concerns you have with the Code of Conduct team.
