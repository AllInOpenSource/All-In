# Site launch checklist
This checklist aims to standardize how we build and ship new sites/pages outside of Dotcom and feature-flag driven development in Dotcom; some steps won‚Äôt be applicable to every project.

To use, copy this master document into a new markdown file within an individual project repo and name it `launch-checklist.md`. If there are particular items that you know don‚Äôt apply to your project (ex: the page doesn‚Äôt have any forms on it), feel free to leave those off. As items are completed throughout development, check them off the list. The launch checklist should be complete before the page(s) are shared to a wider audience of stakeholders for general QA review.
