- question: Does the program accept students in their senior year?
  answer: Yes. However, our corporate partners typically are seeking summer interns rather than full time employees.

- question: When will students know if they have been accepted into the program?
  answer: There is no application process for this program. Please note that when students complete the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMJM7ILztN9Mv1fjLZYN5GniJrcfP_0uG8VW7e3lBULmfohw/viewform" target="_blank">form</a> to join, students must provide a GitHub ID, resume, and LinkedIn profile. Once submitted, students will receive information to start the program via email.

- question: Will the students be paid to participate?
  answer: No. The program is free of cost to participate and students will not be paid. However, students will be eligible for scholarships to attend tech conferences, participate in boot camps, and apply for fellowships. Students are also eligible to participate in hackathons, where cash prizes are available.

- question: What if a student has to miss part of the program?
  answer: We know students have a lot on their plates! Therefore, we have designed the program to be self-paced and able to be completed on a rolling basis. Students should understand internship opportunities are often available to apply to months before the start date. Companies begin placing their interns very early (sometimes even 12 months ahead of the start date!); thus, we highly recommend students get started and complete the requirements to begin applying for internships as soon as possible.

- question: Can we make this curriculum available to other students?
  answer: Yes. Any student from a qualifying school is eligible to join. Computer Science, IT, computer information systems, Cybersecurity, and other tech-related majors and concentrations have priority.

- question: Are students guaranteed an internship?
  answer: We cannot guarantee internships. Our corporate partners make internship opportunities available specifically for All In students, but the students must still apply and interview. Students will be competing against other All In students for the positions. We also understand that only some students want to work for large corporations. There will be opportunities for students to participate in paid internships with startups, nonprofits, and within open-source communities. We also partner with other tech organizations to offer students scholarships to attend boot camps and fellowships.
