- question: Does the program accept students in their senior year?
  answer: Yes. However, our corporate partners typically are seeking summer interns rather than full time employees. For Summer 2023, seniors who are still seeking employment may be placed in positions with open source communities to receive technical skills post graduation.

- question: When will students know if they have been accepted into the program?
  answer: There is no application process for this program. However, students must complete the course requirements and assignments, which include a resume and a LinkedIn profile. Once we receive all the assignments, students will be granted access to the private LinkedIn group, which will have all of the benefits of the complete program.

- question: Will the students be paid to participate?
  answer: Students received stipends during the pilot to complete the coursework and technical experience. This year, summer internships are paid opportunities. They will also be eligible for scholarships to attend tech conferences, participate in boot camps, and apply for fellowships. We will also provide funding for students to participate in an in-person hackathon during Spring 2023, where cash prizes are available.

- question: What if a student has to miss part of the program?
  answer: We know students have a lot on their plates! Therefore, we have designed the program to be self-paced and able to be completed on a rolling basis. Students should understand internship opportunities are available starting in October 2022, meaning the sooner they satisfy the initial requirements, the sooner they can be added to the private LinkedIn group and apply for the internships. Companies begin placing their interns very early; thus, we highly recommend students get started and complete the requirements to begin applying for internships as soon as possible.

- question: Can we make this curriculum available to other students?
  answer: Yes. Any student from our participating schools is eligible to join the program once he/she/they complete the requirements. Computer Science, IT, computer information systems, Cybersecurity, and other tech-related majors and concentrations have priority.

- question: Are students guaranteed an internship?
  answer: We cannot guarantee internships. Our corporate partners make internship opportunities available specifically for All In students, but the students must still apply and interview. Students will be competing against other All In students for the positions. We also understand that only some students want to work for large corporations. There will be opportunities for students to participate in paid internships with startups, nonprofits, and within open-source communities. We also partner with other tech organizations to offer students scholarships to attend boot camps and fellowships.
