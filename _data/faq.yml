- question: Does the program accept students in their senior year?
  answer: Yes. However, our corporate partners typically seek summer interns rather than full-time employees. For Summer 2023, seniors seeking employment may be placed in positions with open-source communities to receive technical skills post-graduation.

- question: Do students have to be computer science majors?
  answer: No.  One of the great benefits of open source is that you can pursue a degree in any major and still succeed!  However, we ask that students complete at least one programming course and have shown dedication and a passion for working in tech.

- question: When will students know if they have been accepted into the program?
  answer: There is no application process for this program.  However, students must complete the course requirements and assignments which include a resume and a LinkedIn profile. Once we receive all of the assignments, students will be granted access to the private LinkedIn group which will have all of the benefits of the full program.

- question: Will students be paid to participate?
  answer: Students received stipends during the pilot to complete the course work and technical experience. This year, students will only be paid for their summer internships.  They will also be eligible to apply for scholarships to attend tech conferences, participate in bootcamps, and apply to fellowships. We will also be providing funding for students to participate in an in person hackathon during Spring 2023 where there will be some cash prizes awarded opportunities to win cash prizes.

- question: What if a student has to miss part of the program?
  answer: We know students have a lot on their plate! Therefore, we have designed the program to be self-paced and able to be completed on a rolling basis. Students should understand that internship opportunities will be made available starting in October 2022, meaning the sooner they complete the initial requirements, the sooner they can be added to the private LinkedIn group and apply for the internships. Companies begin placing their interns very early, thus we highly recommend students get started and complete the requirements to start applying as soon as possible.

- question: Can we make this curriculum available to other students?
  answer: Yes.  Any student from our participating schools is eligible to join the program once he/she/they complete the requirements.  Computer Science, IT, computer information systems, Cybersecurity, and other tech-related majors and concentrations will be given priority.

- question: Are students guaranteed an internship?
  answer: We cannot guarantee internships. Our corporate partners make internship opportunities available specifically for All In students, but students must still apply and interview. Students will be competing against other All In students for the positions. We also understand that not all students want to work for large corporations. There will be opportunities for students to participate in paid internships with startups, nonprofits and within open source communities. We also partner with other tech organizations to offer students scholarships to participate in bootcamps and fellowships.
